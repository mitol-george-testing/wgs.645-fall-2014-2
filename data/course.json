  "course_title": "Gender, Health and Marginalization Through a Critical Feminist Lens",
  "course_description": "In the course we will use a feminist interdisciplinary lens and invite students to look critically at how practices like privatization, shrinking public \"safety nets\", de-regulation, and the commodification of health services intersect inevitably with gender, race and class, for both men and women. We will draw on a blend of empirical studies, policy materials, films and guest speakers to examine specific health issues like menstrual health, corporate obstetrics, abortion, obesity, intersex, harassment and other forms of gendered violence, mental health and stress, parent-child attachment, as well as ethics and pharmaceuticals.\n\nThe Graduate Consortium in Women's Studies (GCWS)\n-------------------------------------------------\n\nThis course is part of the Graduate Consortium in Women's Studies.
